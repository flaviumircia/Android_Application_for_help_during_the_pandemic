# Android Application for help during the SARS-COV2 pandemic
This is my application for the "Scientific Communications Session 2021 " in the first year of university.

## About the app
   The Android Application for Help During the Pandemic was created as a social-oriented app for people that were quarantined 
(implying no possibility of getting out of the house), so they could connect with others from the app to help them (for things like buying groceries or walking the dog).

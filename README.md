# Android_Application_for_help_during_the_pandemic
This is my application for the "Scientific Communications Session 2021 " in the first year of university.
The app concept:
   The Android Application for Help During the Pandemic ( or AAHDP) was created as a social-oriented app for people that were quarantined 
(implying no possibility of getting out of the house), so they could connect with others from AAHDP to help them (for things like buying groceries or walking the dog)
The project is in an early alpha-state, because of the of the little time I had for developing it (~3 weeks), so building it from scratch wasn't easy.
